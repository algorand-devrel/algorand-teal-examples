// given match cases from A[1] to A[N], branch to the Ith label where A[I] = B. Continue to the following instruction if no matches are found.
// Availability: v8
// match consumes N+1 values from the stack. Let the top stack value be B. The following N values represent an ordered list of match cases/constants (A), where the first value (A[0]) is the deepest in the stack. The immediate arguments are an ordered list of N labels (T). match will branch to target T[I], where A[I] = B. If there are no matches then execution continues on to the next instruction.

// Use match to choose which method selector has been provided and branch to the corresponding location.
