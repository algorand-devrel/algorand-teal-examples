// Opcode: 0x4d
// Stack: ..., A, B, C â†’ ..., A or B

// Using select to choose the larger of two values.

// Place two values on the stack, these will be positions A and B.

// Our third argument C will be the result of an expression to identify if A is
// smaller than B. For this we will duplicate both values, and perform a  "less
// than" operator. In this example 42 is less than 1337, so the result
// is a 1 in the C position.

// We then use select which checks the value of C and if it's 0 then A is left
// on the stack, otherwise B is left on the stack. In this example C is 1, so
